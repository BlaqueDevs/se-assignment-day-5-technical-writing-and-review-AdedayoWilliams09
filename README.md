Tech Experts: Use specific terms, detailed data, and advanced concepts.
General Audience: Simplify language, use analogies, and focus on key points.
Visual Learners: Incorporate charts and images.
Auditory Learners: Use clear explanations and engaging dialogue.
Interactive Learners: Include hands-on activities or Q&A sessions.

Ask questions or survey the audience beforehand, observe their reactions during the presentation, and adjust your language based on their responses.
